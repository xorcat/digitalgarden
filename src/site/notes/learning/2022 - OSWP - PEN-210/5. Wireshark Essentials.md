# ❗ 5. Wireshark Essentials

 
## 📦 Resources
- Reading the material on the online course
## 🔑 Key Points
### 5.2. Wireshark Filters
- Using wireshark display filters
- Using wireshark capture filters (AKA Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF)
- Change your channel either in wireshark, or hop automatically with something like [[learning/2022 - OSWP - PEN-210/5. Wireshark Essentials#Channel hopping with iw while using wireshark|this]]:
* Filter out beacons with the capture filter:
    * `not subtype beacon`
* Example of trying to capture only frames from `3A:30:F9:0F:E1:95`:
    * `((wlan addr1 3A:30:F9:0F:E1:95) or (wlan addr2 3A:30:F9:0F:E1:95) or (wlan addr3 3A:30:F9:0F:E1:95) or (wlan addr4 3A:30:F9:0F:E1:95)) and (not subtype beacon)`
* We can also get rid of ctl frames, probe requests and probe responses
    * `and not (subtype beacon) and not (type ctl) and not (subtype probe-req) and not (subtype probe-resp)
* You can also save filters to re-use them later
### 5.4. Remote Packet Capture
* Can perform remote packet captures with `sshdump`
    * Can use `tcpdump`, `dumpcap` or `tshark`; you can output their contents to stdout and then pipe that into wireshark
    * `sudo tcpdump -i wlan0mon -w - -U`
        * `-U` means to output packets as they arrive; instead of buffering them
    * `sudo dumpcap -w - -P -i wlan0mon`
        * `-P` tells dumpcap to output in a pcap format
    * `sudo tshark -w - -i wlan0mon`
* Pipe a tcpdump into wireshark:
    * `sudo tcpdump -U -w - -i wlan0mon | wireshark -k -i -`
* Make a named pipe for wireshark to read from
    * `mkfifo /tmp/named_pipe`
    * `sudo wireshark -k -i /tmp/named_pipe`
    * `sudo tcpdump -U -w - -i wlan0mon > /tmp/named_pipe`
* Use an sshpipe to run a remote capture and display it locally:
    * `ssh root@10.11.0.196 "sudo -S tcpdump -U -w - -i wlan0mon" | sudo wireshark -k -i -`
### 5.5. Advanced Preferences
* Use `wpa_passphrase` to [[learning/2022 - OSWP - PEN-210/5. Wireshark Essentials#Generate a PMK with wpa_passphrase|generate a PMK]] when you have a known SSID and password

### Channel hopping with iw while using wireshark

```bash
for channel in 1 6 11 2 7 10 3 8 4 9 5
do
  iw dev wlan0mon set channel ${channel}
  sleep 1
done
```

### Generate a PMK with `wpa_passphrase`

```bash
$ wpa_passphrase test abcdefg:
network={
        ssid="test"
        #psk="abcdefg:"
        psk=a1c425c0f4e5ff3746920c90cc55d17f4773512b6c1ed415526a3bcea3351b5b
}
```
